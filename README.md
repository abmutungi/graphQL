### graphQL

This repository contains files from a project completed at 01 Founders Coding School. 
It can also be viewed by following the link below where it is hosted:

https://abmutungi-graphql.netlify.app/

The objective of this project was to learn the query language graphQL by creating my own profile page. It is provided,
by the school's platform, a graphQL endpoint that is connected to the database. 

I created a profile UI where one can see my progress at 01F. Using SVG I managed to build several types of graphs including interactive
and animated graphs.

This project introduced me to :

- GraphQL
- GraphiQL
- Hosting
- Basics of human-computer interface
  - UI/UX
